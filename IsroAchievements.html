	<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 100px; font-size: 4vh; margin-right: 100px;">Over the years, ISRO (Indian Space and Research organization) has achieved numerous milestones. Since its inception in 1969, they have time and again proved that they completely stand by their vision to 'harness space technology for national development'.<br><br>Let's take a look at its most significant five achievements-</p><br><br>

	<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 100px; font-size: 7vh; margin-right: 100px;">&#x278A; Launching 104 satellites with one rocket</p>
	<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 140px; font-size: 3vh; margin-right: 140px;">On February 15, ISRO kicked off 2017 with a historic record-breaking launch. In one of the most complicated missions in the history of Indian space exploration, India, with the help of six other nations, launched 104 satellites into space. These satellites were launched in a single launch onboard PSLV-C37. The launch took place on the Sriharikota spaceport in Andhra Pradesh and successfully managed to put these satellites into their desired orbit in one go.</p>

	<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 100px; font-size: 7vh; margin-right: 100px;">&#x278B; South Asia Satellite (GSAT-9) launch</p>
	<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 140px; font-size: 3vh; margin-right: 140px;">The 2230 kg satellite was launched by Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark-II (GSLV-F09) into its planned Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) on May 5, 2017. This was the fourth consecutive success achieved by GSLV carrying indigenously developed Cryogenic Upper Stage. The GSLV-F09's main objective is to establish a smooth communication network amongst the South Asian nations by providing them with applications in Ku-band, which gives them a higher frequency range to communicate in.</p>

	<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 100px; font-size: 7vh; margin-right: 100px;">&#x278C; The launch of ISRO's 'Fat Boy'</p>
	<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 140px; font-size: 3vh; margin-right: 140px;">The 640-tonne Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle-Mark III (GSLV Mk III), also called 'fat boy', weights equal to 200 full-grown Asian elephants. The GSLV Mk III rocket carried a satellite weighing more than three tonnes into a high orbit above Earth.</p>

	<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 100px; font-size: 7vh; margin-right: 100px;">&#x278D; 31 satellites in a single flight</p>
	<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 140px; font-size: 3vh; margin-right: 140px;">On June 23, ISRO achieved this feat too. It must have been a walk in the park for ISRO to launch 31 satellites in one go after already launching 104 satellites in one rocket. The 995-kilogram rocket that comprised 31 satellites from countries like the US, UK, and Germany was  PSLV-C38 (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle). The satellite is being used for monitoring roads and keeping track of water distribution.</p>

	<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 100px; font-size: 7vh; margin-right: 100px;">&#x278E; Sending another communication satellite in the space</p>
	<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 140px; font-size: 3vh; margin-right: 140px;">With already 17 Indian satellites circling the planet, on July 29 ISRO launched 18th communication satellite, GSAT-17, to join the fleet. The GSAT-17 has been designed for an operational lifespan of about 15 years. The spacecraft carries equipment to aid meteorology and search and rescue operations primarily over the Indian sub-continent.</p>
