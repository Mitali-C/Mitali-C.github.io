	<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 100px; font-size: 7vh; margin-right: 100px;">&#10038; What is Marsian?</p>
	<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 140px; font-size: 3vh; margin-right: 140px;">Marsian is an incredible project proposed by the Indian Space Research Organization(ISRO). It is a fantastic platform for the venturous people who had always dreamt of exploring the outer space and walking on the other planets.</p>

	<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 100px; font-size: 7vh; margin-right: 100px;">&#10038; What is the vision of Marsian?</p>
	<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 140px; font-size: 3vh; margin-right: 140px;">The vision of Marsian is not just limited to creating a trip for people. The deep mission of Marsian is to find out the sustainability of human life on another planet!</p>

	<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 100px; font-size: 7vh; margin-right: 100px;">&#10038; What's the point of sending people to Mars in the first place?</p>
	<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 140px; font-size: 3vh; margin-right: 140px;">Given the success humans have had exploring Mars with robots, you might ask why NASA and others are so bent on sending people there — which will be way more difficult, more expensive, and more dangerous.<br><br>Here, Marsian keeps the capablitity of answering such questions by quoting &#x275D;A spirit of exploration has defined our species from the start. It's what's led us to cross the oceans and climb the world's mountains — and now it compels us towards the next frontier, that of interplanetary travel.&#x275E;<br><br>&#x275D;A human Mars mission would mark a new era in the history of our species. Like the moonshot, it would demonstrate the remarkable heights we can achieve when we devote huge amounts of energy and resources toward a truly ambitious goal, rather than war or incremental technological progress. It would give us firsthand knowledge of the planet most like Earth — and open up the possibility that humans might someday be able to colonize it, in case Earth's environment is irrevocably damaged.&#x275E;<br><br>Marsian is surely going to set the bench mark high in the history of space travel!
